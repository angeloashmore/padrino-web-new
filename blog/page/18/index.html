  <p>Fikus dreamed a dream for me / It cost me nothing it was free / He dreamed of walking in the sand / Of blossoms forming in his hand" / — from Fikus, by Phish

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Simple admin interface</li>
  <li>Markdown format for page contents</li>
  <li>Easily extensible using the features of Padrino, Sinatra, and Rack</li>
  <li>Data stored in MongoDB</li>
  <li>Built-in page caching for performance</li>
  <li>Ability to specify different layouts per page</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-fikus">Why Fikus?</h3>

<p>I was in need of a very simple content management system. I wanted to quickly author somewhat static pages together for the web, but I didn’t want to deal with deploying the site, uploading files, or dealing with fitting my content in templates. That ruled out a lot of existing content management systems that did too much for what I wanted.</p>

<p>I also wanted a chance to play with the Padrino framework, which is a MVC architecture framework built on top of Sinatra.</p>

<p>Initially I looked at a CMS like Nesta but decided I wanted my pages (or documents) stored in a document database and a simple admin interface for editing them. I liked the idea of using Markdown, so I decided to create something that fit my needs.</p>

<p>Fikus was born.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-fikus-mean">What does Fikus mean?</h3>

<p>Think of it as a tree, but I was listening to Phish when starting the project. That’s all it is.</p>

<p>Right now the team is very busy working on bug fixes and towards a 1.0 release. There have been bug reports trickling in on Padrino and we have been working to address them in a timely fashion. It is very important that for a 1.0 release that Padrino is rock-solid and easy to use for every experience level. There are a few thoughts I have about this topic of more Padrino resources.</p>

<break>

First, I would love to hear more of all your thoughts about this subject. Email us, leave comments, send us Github messages about what you would like to see while learning Padrino. This is really important in trying to understand the next steps to improving the Padrino experience.

Second, the desire for more screencasts is noted. One interesting screencast the Padrino team would love to see is a Padrino peepcode video that builds on the basics taught in the Sinatra screencast. There is a feedback forum for Peepcode here: [Peepcode Padrino Screencast](http://suggestions.peepcode.com/forums/15-general/suggestions/1064769-padrino) . If you are interested in a high quality video going in-depth about the various aspects of Padrino, let Peepcode know. We would be very excited to see this come to fruition.

Third, we welcome contributors. If you want to improve documentation, add tutorials or pages to our website documentation, add padrino guides, or anything else to improve the state of Padrino, please let us know! We are happy to talk with you and work with you to make Padrino an easier to use web development framework.

Thanks for reading and I appreciate the support given by the Padrino community.
